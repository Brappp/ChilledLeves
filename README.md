# LeveItAlone
Another leve turnin plugin that might never get finished

### Current Plans
- [ ] Improve the Turnin NPC to see if there are multiple leves to be turned in
- [ ] Fix mount roulette (for characters that only have 1 mount)
- [ ] 

Future plans:
- [ ] Make it to where if you're at the leve vendor, able to grab multiple classes of leves if possible [Not just CUL for instance, but CUL, BSM, and ARM if they're all in the same city]
- [ ] Provide an indicator for all potentional leves that you can do in the main Ui (might have to look into allagan tools for this implimentation)

Finished Plans:
- [ ]
